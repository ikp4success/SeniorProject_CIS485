Progress â€“ September 11, 2015
Team: Immanuel, Dan, David, George
	This week, we hashed out more details about how we want to approach the user interface, and some members did a little research on php, Javascript, and JQuery.  David and Immanuel worked on setting up the initial database, while we all tried to figure out a good way to organize/connect the different tables.  Immanuel was able to get the registration/login page working, with assistance from David and Dan as far as connecting to the database and testing.  The test for registering a new user was successful.
	Moving forward, we plan to further flesh out the layout, design and architecture of the main app, while integrating more tables and getting some script done.  Also, a bit more research will be commenced for those who are newer to Javascript and JQuery
